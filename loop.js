// Step 1: define a function and call it whatever you like with no inputs
// Step 2: create an array named favoriteThings, put 5 strings 
// into your array of things that you like. It can be movies, shows, sports, etc.
//		- How to make an array: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
// Step 3: Use a while loop to console.log() each of the items in your array, 
// BE CAREFUL, if you don't do this correctly, you may crash your computer!
//		- How to make a while loop: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while
// Step 4: Call the function so that it runs. 
// So if you called your function, "favoriteThingsLogger", type
// favoriteThingsLogger(); 
// on a separate line outside of the function. This will call your function when
// the program runs.
// Step 5: Ask a teacher to check your code, before you run it so you don't crash your computer
// After your teacher approves, type "node loop.js" in your terminal to see the logs!



// Once you're done, raise your hand, and a teacher will approve of your code!
